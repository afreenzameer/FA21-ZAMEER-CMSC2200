Time for completion: 30 minutes

This lab was pretty simple for me. I was able to compile and run both the programs on Command Prompt. I did run into an issue when trying to run the HelloWorld program because instead of writing java HelloWorld, I wrote java HelloWorld.class. I assumed the name would be the same as I saw when I did a dir, but the .class was not needed. It gave me an error message, but I figured out pretty quickly what the error was and was able to run the program. 

In the future I think it would be helpful to go over the different arguments and what they do, because I was only able to figure out how to run a program with an argument after asking a classmate for help.
