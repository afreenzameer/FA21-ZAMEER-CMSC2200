This lab was extremely difficult for me. I was able to handle the primitive types and string part, but the reverse string portion was really confusing and I could not figure out how to do it without help during office hours. After an explanation it made more sense to me though. The conditional portion was also really difficult, mostly because I was getting confused on the syntax and my command prompt kept showing errors with my braces. After using intellij though I think that really cleared up a lot of the syntax issues I was having, and the rest came easier. I also needed clarification on how to do a ternary, which I got during office hours. The loop portion of the lab was easiest for me, though I did run into an error where it kept saying I needed a return statement. Overall this lab was very hard but I do feel as though I understand the code as well as syntax better. I would love to go over again in class what the categories of words like in public static string main are and what other words they can be substituted with, because I think I forget which words belong to which category. I'd also like it if we could go over the syntax we should use for things like a ternary or an enhanced for loop again in class.

This lab was pretty simple for me. I was able to compile and run both the programs on Command Prompt. I did run into an issue when trying to run the HelloWorld program because instead of writing java HelloWorld, I wrote java HelloWorld.class. I assumed the name would be the same as I saw when I did a dir, but the .class was not needed. It gave me an error message, but I figured out pretty quickly what the error was and was able to run the program. 

In the future I think it would be helpful to go over the different arguments and what they do, because I was only able to figure out how to run a program with an argument after asking a classmate for help.
