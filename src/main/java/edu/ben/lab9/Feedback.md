## Lab 9 Feedback

Nice job with this, there are only two minor errors. One, you are not placing the Cars ito an array, you are simply printing them when they are made. 
Two, your file is hardcoded to the absolute path. When someone runs this on their laptop, they will not have your user route, so the program will break.

Otherwise, nice job!
